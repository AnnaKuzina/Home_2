# Home_Work_2

Mandatory task:
Implement a game “Guess number”. Program chooses random number and asks user to input one. If user inputs correct number – win, game over; otherwise program prints hint – user’s input was greater or less, than program’s number. Repeats until user enters correct number.

Optional advanced task:
Implement program, which takes command line arguments in any order and outputs them to console in format “<parameter_name>: <value>”, if input was correct, otherwise outputs short help.
Parameters: number, flag, string. “number” can be any integer number, mandatory parameter. “flag” is bool, can be passed in formats “--flag” (equals to “--flag true”) or “--flag true”/”--flag false”. “string” any non-empty quoted string, optional parameter.
Parameter starts with “--”, value is divided from parameter with space or “=“ (on your choice, any one of them or both options).

Suggestions for optional task: look at TryParse; also, choosing both parameter-value delimiters makes the task much harder.
